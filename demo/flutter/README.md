# Porcupine Flutter Demo

To run the Porcupine demo on Android or iOS with Flutter, you must have the [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) installed on your system. Once installed, you can run `flutter doctor` to determine any other missing requirements for your relevant platform. Once your environment has been set up, launch a simulator or connect an Android/iOS device. 

## Usage

Run the following command from [demo/flutter](demo/flutter/) to build and deploy the demo to your device:
```sh
flutter run
```
