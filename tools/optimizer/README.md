# Porcupine Optimizer

The optimizer enables developers to build models for their wake words of choice. Below it is assumed that the current 
working directory is the root of the repository. ```${SYSTEM}``` refers to the operating system (linux, mac, or windows) and
```${MACHINE}``` refers to CPU architecture (x86_64 or i386).

# Usage

The optimizer utility is located at [/tools/optimizer](/tools/optimizer).
```tools/optimizer/${SYSTEM}/${MACHINE}/pv_porcupine_optimizer -h``` gives the usage string as below

```
 [INFO] Usage: pv_porcupine_optimizer -r resource_directory -w keyword -p platform -o output_directory
 [INFO] Optimizes keyword spotting model (aka porcupine) for a given keyword and stores the result into a file.
 [INFO] 
 [INFO]  -r Absolute path to resource directory that contains data needed by optimizer.
 [INFO]  -w Keyword.
 [INFO]  -p Target platform for running keyword spotting module. Valid options are: linux, mac, and windows.
 [INFO]  -o Absolute path to output directory where keyword file will be stored.
```

In this repository, the resource directory is located at [/resources](/resources). Keyword files are
platform dependent. This means that a keyword file generated with ```-p linux``` cannot run on Android or Mac. The
optimizer available at this repository can produce keyword files for Linux and Mac platforms. Custom keyword files for 
platforms other than Linux and Mac are provided with a purchase of the commercial license. In order to purchase a commercial
license please contact us at sales@picovoice.

A keyword file for **Vancouver** targeted for a Mac machine can be created using

```bash
tools/optimizer/${SYSTEM}/${MACHINE}/pv_porcupine_optimizer -r resources -w vancouver -p mac -o ~/
```

# FAQ

#### How do I create keyword files for platforms other than Linux/Mac/Windows?

The optimizer provided in this repository does not have the capability to do so. Custom keyword files for 
platforms other than Linux, Mac, or Windows are provided with purchase of the commercial license. In order to purchase a commercial
license please contact us at sales@picovoice.

#### How do I deal with "[ERROR] could not find the pronunciation of XXX"?

The optimizer has information about thousands of commonly-used English words. That being said, your chosen keyword might
not be available in its internal dictionary. Please contact us at contact@picovoice.ai. We can provide you with
requested keyword file and will add the word to optimizer's internal dictionary for next release.
